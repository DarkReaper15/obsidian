## visual searching
- Always maintain a visual lead/visual search of 20-30 seconds down your intended path of travel. Search for objects and conditions that can affect your path of travel.

- Visual control zone of 12-15 seconds ahead (1 city block). Look for changes in traction and alternate routes
## lights
- DRLs are Daytime Running Lights. They should be left on during the day so that other vehicles can see you.
	- If your vehicle does not have DRLs, you should drive with your low beam headlights even during the day time

## correct driving speed and distance
- ### Driving speed
	
 1.  A reasonable proper speed is one that allows the driver a safe path of travel under any set of conditions. 

 2.  How fast you drive is determined by
			1. The posted speed limit
			2.  Highway Conditions
- ### Driving Distance
	1. In clear conditions stay 3-5 seconds behind the vehicle in front of you. (following distance)
	2. add one second follow for rain, two seconds for large trucks. 
	3. Always have an escape route at least in front and one side
- #### Prepare to change speed or change direction to manage or control the situation.
## trucks
- Do not drive next to large trucks for long periods of time as they have large blind spots and the driver may not see you.

## pedestrians 

- you have a moral and legal obligation to the safety of pedestrians. 

## move over and emergency vehicle laws

- emergency vehicle law: pull over to the right side of the road.
- Move over law: move into the other lane when there is a stopped vehicle. 

## Right of way rules: 

1. The right of way is not something that is taken but is given.
2. The last person who has the clear chance to avoid the collision has the obligation to do so.

## The express way
1. When you are leaving the express way you decelerate
3. When you are entering the express way you accelerate. 
4. let the person off the express way. 

## Passing questions
1. is it legal?
	1. It is illegal to pass with double yellow
	2. it is illegal to pass on railroad track
	3. it is illegal to pass in intersection
	4. it is illegal to pass in a tunnel
	5. it is illegal to pass on bridge
2. is it safe?
3. is it worth it?
## merging and lane changes
- when changing lanes
	1. check all sides for a safe gap in traffic
	2. signal
	3. recheck blind areas to the rear in the direction of movement
	4. steer into the new lane
	5. when safe cancel the signal
## checking blind areas
-  To check your blind areas, turn your head and check over your shoulder in the direction you are turning.
## turning
- ### Turning speed
	- as a new drive you should not exceed 5 to 15 mph when turning
	## turning around (reversing direction)
	-  ### Three point turnabout(risky)
		-  make a hard turn into the other lane, back back into your own lane, now facing the opposite direction, now merge into the other lane. You have now turned around.
			-  Only make a three point turnabout in very light direction
	- ### two turn point turnabout from least risk to most (less risky)
		1. back into the drive way on the right
			- back in the drive way on the right. Turn out into the road.
		2. turn into drive way on the left.
			- turn into the drive way on the left. Back out into the road.
		3. turn into the drive way on the right
			- turn into the drive way on the right. back out into the road.
- ### uturn (most risky)
	- turn directly into the other lane, either at an intersection or at any point along the road.
- ### If you have the option of making a 2 point turn about, u turn or going counter clock-wise around the block, you should always go around the block.
## choosing( buying, purchasing) a vehicle
- Drl lights
- electronic stability control or esc. Increases the stability of the vehicle.
- power steering
- Abs, anti-lock breaking system, enhances your ability to steer while braking hard
- air bags, side and rear bags. 
- head restraints, prevents whiplash 
- reliability, a warranty is good and history is important.
### the three big things
1. safety
2. reliability
3. affordability
## insuring a vehicle
- Liability insurance: Liability only pays for damage that you cause to something or someone else.
	1. bodily injury
	2. property damage
	3. You can also get "uninsured motorist". It doesn't increase you're rates when you use it.
- Collision Insurance: Pays for damage to your vehicle regardless of fault.
	1. If you fail to stop at a stop sign and get into a collision collision insurance will still pay you. 
	2. Will pay you if the collision is your fault
- Deducible is payed by you, can be between $100 - $2000 
- comprehensive insurance. 
	1. accidental damage; ie tree
	2. theft
	3. floods
	4. vandalism
	5.  total value is payout from total 
- insurance companies consider
	1. driving record
		1. Claims 
		2. crashes
	2. age
	3. value and age of vehicle
	4. where you live
	5.  car safety features
- rental car insurance.
- On private property police don't issue fault. For fast coverage you need no fault insurance. 
- Deprecated value check from car accident.
	1. If you are at fault your insurance company pays
	2. If you are not at fault, the other person pays. 
-  get aaa rather than though roadside insurance.
