1. precipitation
	-  double replacement
2. acid/base
	- acid/base (neutralization)
3. oxidation
	- reduction (redox)
	- oxidation #'s (states)
	- single replacment 
		- all single replacment reaction are oxidation but not all oxidation reactions are single replacment. 
4. net ionic equations
	- molecular
	- total ionic

spectator ions are not involved in the chemical reaction










solutions of the different ionic compound are mixed one compound is formed which is insoluble in aqueous solution and therefore precipitates.
